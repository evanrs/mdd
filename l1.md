# Top Three
## Affording a better life
Saying, I want to be paid more so I'm going to work alone… it feels a little crass. When what I want is a deeper commitment to what I do that fulfills me. And I want that in a way that rewards others and commands a higher rate. I am a poor opportunist, I've put too much stock in the ability of my jobs to provide that fulfillment. At this point I feel enabled by a sense of self that is honed on my direction. I believe I will know fulfillment on my own path.

## Design that inspires
Working independently gives me a better chance of working with designers who inspire me. The opportunity to work with a designer far exceeding my ability gives me freedom to focus on the execution of that idea.

With some exceptions my experience with designers—especially the non coding variety—has been severely underwhelming. At times it has been painful. My dedication is compromised by bad design and more difficult designers. Feeling a connection with my work preoccupies me with wanting the best for it.

## Freedom to explore
Working independently lets me explore new solutions more often. That keeps me excited, nimble, and engaged in the community. Community engagement is the best way for me find new projects that pique my interest. Excitement around a new solution keeps my attention.
