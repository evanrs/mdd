Responsibility
- delivering on time
- managing self
- marketing, hr, operations, support (self, self supportâ€¦)

Uncertainty
- variable income
- trends, tech changes (seems like you'd be more nimble)

Independence
- isolation (big concern)
- just a vendor (replacable)
- perceived as 'really just unemployed'

challenges of independence, concerns?
closing on contracts, getting first payment, negotiating rate. getting paid in time for rent.

how can you minimize risk of concerns?
See how others do it. Look at their contracting schemes. Look for smaller jobs when bigger ones are taking time.

what's the worst that can happen, what would happen if you failed?
1. increased debt
  There is some initial financing in order to dedicate time to potential clients, there may be debt involved. The effect would last even after switching back to salaried employment, making it the most concerning. There is no reset just by returning to the status quo.
2. take a salaried position
  This is an acceptable exit, but not so when reaching an "end of the rope" scenario. Choosing employment out of necessity necessarily leads to a compromised choice. There is a chance that an ideal employer would be found, but there is a lower chance that there will be time to find them.
